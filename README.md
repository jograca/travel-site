## Travel Site Web App

### G4C Project from November 14th

In this project:

* A Spring MVC was setup to display a default HTML page. The HTML page was provided
* Using CSS, a series of element formatting instructions were followed to match the provided page with the expected result


Included here in the 'develop' branch, I removed the instances of the images included in the static resources of  the project and link to copies I uploaded to an S3 bucket.
