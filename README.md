## Travel Site Web App

### G4C Project from November 14th

In this project:

* A Spring MVC was setup to display a default HTML page. The HTML page was provided
* Using CSS, a series of element formatting instructions were followed to match the provided page with the expected result


In this version I uploaded the images we used to S3 and made them public. In a previous commit I have the images contained in the project:
